P1 - Alpha
During Alpha we open the MEV Bot for public testing, enabling everyone to use the platform and experience its functionalities. Key highlights of this phase include:
Public Testing: The MEV Bot becomes accessible to all users, providing them with the opportunity to test and provide feedback on the platform's performance and features.
ERC-20 Token Launch: Concurrently with the Alpha Launch, we initiate the launch of the ERC-20 token $MEVX. Holders of $MEVX will gain exclusive access to the MEV Bot's services during the Beta phase.
User Feedback Collection: We actively encourage users to share their feedback, suggestions, and bug reports to help us refine and optimize the MEV Bot for a smoother experience.
P2 - Beta
Beta marks a significant upgrade to the MEV Bot, with the introduction of revenue sharing and partnership opportunities. Key features of this phase include:
Version  2.0.1
Revenue Share for $MEVX Holders: During the Beta phase, $MEVX holders will receive a share of the profits generated by the MEV Bot. This revenue-sharing mechanism strengthens the bond between the platform and its community.
Partnership Opportunities: We extend an exciting opportunity to other token communities, allowing them to receive 1% of the 4% revenue generated by the MEV Bot. This move fosters collaboration and expands the network of partnerships within the DeFi space.
Tax Utilization for $MEVX Growth: The taxes collected from the project's revenue will be strategically reinvested into the $MEVX chart, ensuring continuous growth and liquidity for the token.
P3 - Charlie
Charlie represents a new milestone in the development and expansion of the MEV Bot ecosystem. Key highlights of this phase include:
CEX Listings: We secure listings on prominent centralized exchanges (CEX), providing increased accessibility and exposure to a broader audience of traders and investors.
Tier 1 Partnerships: Collaborations with Tier 1 partners enhance the credibility and reach of the MEV Bot project, opening up new opportunities for growth and innovation. 
MevX team will form a strategic partnership allocating a percent of Revshare to holders of that community.
Telegram Bot Deployable MEV Launch: The Telegram bot, developed in earlier phases, is now deployable for active management and deployment of MEV strategies directly from Telegram accounts, streamlining user experience.
Dapp Revenue Tracker: We introduce a Dapp revenue tracker, allowing users to monitor and analyze the performance of their MEV strategies and revenue share in real-time.



With a well-defined roadmap spanning Alpha, Beta, and Charlie launches, we are dedicated to delivering an exceptional MEV Bot platform that maximizes profitability, fosters partnerships, and creates sustainable growth for the $MEVX ecosystem. As we progress through these phases, we remain committed to driving innovation and adding value to our users and the DeFi community at large.
